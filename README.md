# codefundo 2019 idea
# Title - securing electrol process using azure blockchain.
# Idea is as follows :-
1) Firstly we can add each and every citizen linked with an adhaar card who are above 18 to a voters list and we can use blockchain to verify that no user is mistakenly adeed twice. As adhaar card is compulsory for every citizen of India so as soon as they turn 18 we can use blockchain to automate their entry in the electrol list and it would also ensure that that every user is identified uniquely.

2)Secondly for the location we can use blockchain in collaboration with GPS so that every citizen's position is uniquely identified and they can cast their vote from their desired location. We can use blockchain to ensure that every individual can caste their vote only once from a uniquely identified location so this would also ensure there is not a multiple casting of vote from a single citizen . In this respect blockchain would help us a lot to ensure security of single candidate single vote .

# This is all about it. Please review it so that i can start working on it.
